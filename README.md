##What I have leaarned

I have not been able to get much time due to endsem. Shortly after endsem, I had gone to village and it was very busy there with minimal internet connection.
Also I had SOS and learner space courses.
What I want to say is that I have not actually created the repository from scratch but have cloned and edited the mentor's repository
However, I also want to ensure that, even though I have not created and coded everything from scratch myself, I understand what has been covered up until week 2.
In the course of SOC, I have understood the concept of Reinforcement Learning, Markov Decision Processes and basic Dynamic Prograaming concepts. However, I do not know how to completely code those algorithms
I also ensure that as I am at home now, I will quickly finish the coding part.
Kind regards,
Hardik
